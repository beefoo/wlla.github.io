    <h1>Presentations</h1>
    <p>Documents are often prepped for a presentation so here are some tips:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>People signal in a variety of ways. For instance, if you have a question and answer section, people can let you know they have a question by raising their hand, speaking their name, or otherwise getting attention.</li>
      <li>Allow time for people to ask questions. When you open the floor for questions, wait a good amount of time. People need time to process this switch and prepare any questions.</li>
      <li>Provide printed material in print, large print, and braille.</li>
      <li>Circulate your presentation materials digitally before the event.</li>
      <li>If you have visual materials or demonstrations provide verbal descriptions of them. If you present a lot of slideshows, get into the habit of describing things. For example, "The image on the slide is our team photo from last year's retreat." Or if you have a chart, summarize.</li>
      <li>Make sure anything on the screen is spoken or shared.</li>
      <li>Check the aucoustics of the space, use a microphone, and to speak directly into it.</li>
      <li>Arrange CART and ASL when needed.</li>
      <li>Start a presentation with an access check. Ask participants if there are any issues with the setup. I'll say something like: "Just to do a quick access check: is my volume okay, am I speaking at an okay pace?"</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- <h2>Logistics</h2>
    <p>Include a mix of seating options. Make sure there are chairs for those who will need to sit. Make sure the space works for participants using wheelchairs.</p> -->
