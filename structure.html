    <h1>DRAFT - Structure</h1>
    <p>Sturcture! What a marvel. Structure is great. In this context, I'm using it to describe the fundamental organization, hierarchy, and semantics of digital materials. How is a page organized.</p>
    <p>Structure is vital because it feeds into clear communication and content. It's important that it is programmatically available. </p>
    <!-- <h2>Long Winded Cookbook Analogy</h2>
    <p>When thinking about structure, I like to think about cookbooks.</p>
    <p>Recipes often are fantastically structured. (That's why they pop up in neat-o digital projects.)</p>
    <p>Let's say I've got <i>The Fannie Merritt Farmer Boston Cooking School Cookbook</i>, <i>The Taste of Country Cooking</i> by Edna Lewis, and <i>Bernard Clayton's New Complete Book of Breads: Revised and Expanded</i> by Bernard Clayton.</p>
    <p>I have these in print in my library; they are hardback and some have dust jackets. Inside, each of these cookbooks have the same basic format:
      <ol>
        <li>Frontismatter</li>
        <li>Title page</li>
        <li>Table of contents</li>
        <li>Sections with recipes</li>
        <li>Index</li>
      </ol>
      The Table of Contents that is organized into sections and subsections. There might be some description, but for the most part it's the titles of the section and recipes. Some of the sections from Fannie Farmer are "Soups and Chowders", "Stuffings", "Garnishes and Relishes." In the bread cookbook its "Buckwheat breads", "Festive breads", "Salt-Rising Breads".</p>
      <p>The indices list out ingredients ("cornmeal"), techniques ("Vacuum-sealing, about"), and recipes ("Red Flannel Hash").</p>
      <p>Writing indices is an art. In print, you want to be comprehensive, you have to think of the different terms someone might use (pancakes versus flapjacks), sometimes you need to make it nested (ex cakes) but you have to make it short enough that it is useful to scan.</p>
      <p>For instance "Cake" is broken into categories like "Cake, coffee", "Cakes, Loaf and Layer," "Cakes, (<i>see also</i> Patties)", "Cakes, Small (<i>see also</i> Bars; Cakes, Coffee, Cakes, Loaf and Layer, Cookies)". These are further subdivided, for instance "Fruit" has "Birthday, Dark, Layer for Bride's, Light, and Wedding"
      Think of a reference style cookbook. A cook book with hundreds of recipes and a wide set of techniques.</p>
      <p>I know what to expect from most cook books; I can expect a Table of Contents, recipes (often organized by sections), and an index. I know where to scan for what I'm looking for. Then the recipies are all generally composed in the same way for each book. Either narratively or more organized.</p>
      <p>I think my cookbook analogy extends to other types of cookbooks too. My copy of [name of book] doesn't have 100s of recipes, but is clearly organized.</p> -->
    <!-- <p>Imagine a cookbook about baking bread. There's a section of frontmatter with introductory pages, including things like the title and the author name. Then a table of contents. Then there are sections for different kinds of bread: yeasted, quick, sweet, holiday. Within each section are sets of recipes. Inside each recipe, thery maybe little callouts that relate to the recipe but offer more information, like "did you know yeast can be stored in the freezer." At the end of the book is an index listing many ingredients and techniques that a user can use to reference different sections.</p> -->
