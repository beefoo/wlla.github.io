    <h1>Headings</h1>
    <p>Headings hierarchically organize digital content. Headings are semantic and visual formatting. They break up and identify sections of a page.</p>
    <p>You may have learned how to make a outline in school. These are high level maps to the content: nested lists of the title, main topics, and subtopics. Headings should be like one of these outlines. If you took only the headings from a page and read through them, you should have a decent sense of what the page covers.</p>
    <p>Headings are semantic: they are designated visually and programmatically (in the code.) If you're using styling to break up sections of a page, check that the headings are also semantic. (On the flip side, never use a semantic heading just for the formatting).</p>
    <p>In terms of visual formatting, a heading should be distinct from regular text and distinct in more than just a color difference. Use font size, weight, decoration, and padding to create unique styles for each heading level.</p>
    <p>In HTML, there are six levels of headings; that convention is true in other web technologies like PDFs and MS Word. You certainly don't need to use all six levels of headings. Think about what is meaningful in the page. If you have a short page and 100 headings, it's not so useful. On this page, there are just two levels of headings.</p>
    <p>In HTML, heading elements are written with the letter "h" followed by the level number; so, people will often refer to headings in this convention with "h1" referring to a heading level one and so on.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There should be one Heading level one, <code>`h1`</code>, on each page.</li>
      <li>The <code>`h1`</code> should be the title of the page.</li>
      <li>The h1 will often be the same text as the <code>title</code> </li>
      <li>Subsequent headings should be <code>h2</code>-<code>h6</code>.</li>
      <li>Never skip headings; meaning never go from an <code>h2</code> to an <code>h4</code>. (Though you can move from an <code>h6</code> to an <code>h3</code>.)
    </ul>
    <h2>Screenreaders & Headings</h2>
    <p>When you hit a heading with a screenreader, it will announce the heading text and the heading level.</p>
    <p>When you first navigate to a page with a screenreader, it may announce the total number of headings on a page. </p>
    <p>With screenreaders, you can skim through all the headings in a page in order to navigate to important sections and get a sense of the page content. Other users visually skim the page for the headings for the same reason.</p>
    <p>There are keyboard shortcuts for skimming through all the headings in a page or through all the headings of a certain level in a page.</p>
    <h2>Checking for Headings</h2>
    <p>Missing or incorrect heading structure is an extremely common accessibility barrier. Since it's a fundamental, paying attention to your headings is a good first step in making things accessible.</p>
    <p>On a webpage, you have a couple of options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The WAVE tool or the aXe tools</li>
      <li>The Visual Bookmarklet</li>
      <li>Skimming through the headings with a screenreader</li>
    </ul>
